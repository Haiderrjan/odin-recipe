# odin-recipe
in this project, i have cerated a simple website of foods that i like to eat on a daily basis. these foiods are not my own however its the food that i normally eat and its a similar recipe that i create at home. 
in this project i learn how to add list in website aswell as imgages. i also learn how to go from one html page to another. lastly i did commits even though it was not needed but i did it just to get the hang of using git commit and the branch system.
