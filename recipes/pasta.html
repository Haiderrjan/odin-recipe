    <h2>Description of Pasta</h2>
    <p>
    This recipe is for a Spicy Chicken Pasta. A few weeks ago, I wanted a quick pasta dish but with a little spice. 
    So I decided to use up a spicy pasta sauce I had in the cupboard, and add chicken and vegetables to it. 
    It turned out really well topped with grated cheese, and was the ultimate comfort food since it was really 
    cold on that day.
