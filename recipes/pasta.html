    <h2 class="heading-2">Description of Pasta</h2>
    <p class="pasta-p">
    This recipe is for a Spicy Chicken Pasta. A few weeks ago, I wanted a quick pasta dish but with a little spice. 
    So I decided to use up a spicy pasta sauce I had in the cupboard, and add chicken and vegetables to it. 
    It turned out really well topped with grated cheese, and was the ultimate comfort food since it was really 
    cold on that day.

<li>Heat a few tablespoons vegetable oil, and add the sliced onions.</li>
<li>Stir-fry until golden brown.</li>
<li>Add 1 pound boneless chicken pieces.</li>
<li>Stir-fry the chicken until it turns white.</li>

<li>Add 1/2 cup water.</li>
<li>Stir-fry on medium heat until the water has dried out.</li>
<li>Take 1 chopped red and green bell pepper, 
    Take 2 cups frozen sweetcorn, or you
